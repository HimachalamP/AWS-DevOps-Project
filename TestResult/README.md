## VM BASED BUILD AND DEPLOYMENT VIA TOMCAT CI/CD Pipeline Project
 
Built hands-on CI/CD Pipeline Project using AWS:

I've recently been working on enhancing my DevOps expertise by building a CI/CD pipeline using some cutting-edge technologies. Here’s a quick overview of the stack I experimented with:

* GitHub for version control
* Jenkins for continuous integration
* Maven for build automation
* SonarQube for code quality analysis
* Jfrog to store artifacts
* Tomcat for managing and deploying the application

This hands-on project has been a fantastic way to brush up my skills and stay current with industry practices. From automating builds and tests to ensuring smooth deployments, every step has deepened my understanding of efficient, reliable software delivery.

I’m excited about the potential of these technologies to streamline development workflows and boost productivity.
